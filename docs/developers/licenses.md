# IoT Ensemble Licenses

## Shared Plans
Our shared plans are geared at offering a more structured understanding of cost and data velocity.  Great for teams new to IoT or lacking cloud-native experience, one of our shared plans will offer a cost per device understanding as the IoT solution scales.  If our shared plans don't fit the IoT project needs, look at how the enterprise plans can help you.
