# Setting Up IoT Ensemble

Fathym IoT Ensemble enables developers to rapidly connect devices using best practice workflows for cloud-native IoT applications.

In this getting started guide, in only a few clicks you'll be able to work with custom and emulated device data.  We'll walk through connecting a first device, and once setup, show how to access device data and connect it with downstream technologies (AI/ML, PowerBI, JS).  Finally, we'll walk through how to deliver these visualizations to customers in a secure way.  

To kick things off, visit the [IoT Ensemble](https://www.iot-ensemble.com/dashboard) sign up page (no credit card required) and access the dashboard.

## IoT Ensemble Dashboard

Once signed in, the IoT Ensemble Dashboard will load with a Free License.  A one stop, cloud-native IoT starting point, the dashboard is a control system for data emulation, connecting devices, understanding data and connecting with downstream services.
